Situations are presented to the candidate via computer-based animation, and the candidate is offered a set of behaviors from which to choose the most and least effective responses. The behaviors vary in the extent to which the sales associate may: direct a conversation toward a commitment or sale, listen carefully to customers and provide options that address what they really need/want, put aside work to assist a customer, and focus on meeting customer needs. Responses are tracked and compared against expert ratings of effectiveness. The test produces an overall score, as well as scores on two subscales, Customer Service Effectiveness and Sales Effectiveness.

By offering a wide range of perspectives, 360 feedback gives employees a more thorough understanding of not only their strengths, weaknesses, and development opportunities, but also their impact on others. 360-degree multi-rater assessments are based on SHL’s Universal Competency Framework (“UCF”), using our proven library of research-driven competencies to provide opportunities for managers, peers, and direct reports to supply useful developmental feedback that they may not otherwise share. SHL can also offer support and training throughout the entire process, from defining objectives through interpreting and delivering the feedback. 360 feedback serves all levels and industries and is a positive and powerful addition to your performance management system.
