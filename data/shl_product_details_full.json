      "description": "The PJM Report provides a clear indication of each candidate's \"degree of fit\" to a role. Provides targeted assessment results that match individuals with jobs . Links the essential/desirable competencies for a specific job with an individual’s competency potential. Provides an overall Match (or fit) Score useful in ranking/sorting candidates for selection and/or development (e.g. Talent Audit). It provides a highly visual profile of a candidate's strengths and limitations against identified required competencies. Includes a summary table that enables prioritisation of action planning for development of critical competencies for an individual (by tabling Competency Potential against Job Importance for the role). It includes highly descriptive statements about a candidate's strengths and development needs/limitations. The extended report versions include proposed competency-based interview questions to enable probing of specific situations in which the candidate might have demonstrated critical job behaviours. The PJM Report is designed for use by line managers and HR professionals in selection and development situations. It is valuable for identifying an individual's overall fit as well as likely areas of strength and weakness relative to their behaviour at work. In a selection context, this information can be used: For making interviewers aware of the areas that may need further probing. As a basis for suggesting and creating relevant interview questions. For identifying the relative strengths and weaknesses of shortlisted candidates.",

For example, the question may ask for a date, name or place that can be found by closely reading through the passage. Alternatively, the questions may be general in nature, with answers that can be determined only by fully understanding the meaning of the passage. \"What is the theme of the passage?\" or \"What is the mood of the author?\" are examples of general questions the candidate may be asked.",

      "description": "SHL 360, or the Multi-Rater Feedback System (‘MFS’), provides a holistic 360-degree view of an employee by gathering feedback from the employee’s manager, peers, direct reports, and/or other raters. By offering a wide range of perspectives, 360 feedback gives employees a more thorough understanding of not only their strengths, weaknesses, and development opportunities, but also their impact on others. 360-degree multi-rater assessments are based on SHL’s Universal Competency Framework (“UCF”), using our proven library of research-driven competencies to provide opportunities for managers, peers, and direct reports to supply useful developmental feedback that they may not otherwise share. SHL can also offer support and training throughout the entire process, from defining objectives through interpreting and delivering the feedback. 360 feedback serves all levels and industries and is a positive and powerful addition to your performance management system.",
